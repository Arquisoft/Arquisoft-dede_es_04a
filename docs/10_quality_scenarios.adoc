Quality Scenarios::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]

.Security
* SOLID: The use of Solid PODs helps each client to own their data and avoid data loss.
* Privacy: Each user will only be able to know his data as well as the products in the basket.

.Usability
* Good interface: The application should have a good interface for all customers, whether or not they have experience in online stores. In addition, the interface should also facilitate the work of administrators.
* Internationalization: The application will be implemented in English so that it can be used by more people.
* Interaction: The interface should make the customer feel comfortable through a readable and functional presentation of the products.

.Integrity
* User - Admin: Users (clients and administrators), will have different options within the application depending on their role.
* Products: The products in the store must be constantly updated (new products and new stock) and never with inconsistent values.

.Performance
* Response time: Response times should be as short as possible so as not to make the user impatient.
*Low latency: This requirement will help meet low response times.
* Efficiency: The code should be as optimal as possible for the application to run efficiently.
