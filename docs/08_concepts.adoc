== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== User interface

To create the user interface we will use the React library together with Typescript. React provides a great
great help when creating interfaces, as it is based on components, which are logical
and self-contained pieces of code. By putting several components together, a user interface can be obtained.

=== Security

In terms of security, our application will follow SOLID principles and our users will use their own PODS to access it.

=== Persistence

For persistence we will use the MongoDB database together with the Mongoose ODM (Object Document Mapping),
since it provides a lot of functionalities to work with MongoDB. We decided to use MongoDB
as it is recommended for projects such as ours where we are developing an online store
and it is very easy to integrate with Node.js, and since we are going to use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node),
this comes in very handy when it comes to work.
