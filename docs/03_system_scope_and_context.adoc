== System Scope and Context

The project we are going to develop is aimed at the online sale of technological products and video games.

These products will be grouped by sections within the page itself, and each product will have the following components: 

* Name.
* Price.
* Add to cart option.
* View option (to show the details).
* Image.

=== Business Context

The home page will show all the products available in the shop. The customer will be able to log into the service as well as to register himself, regardless of this he will be able to search for the desired technology by name or a price range, then the list of products corresponding to the selected filter will be displayed. If the usser is logged he will be able to add the products to a shopping basket, a list made up of all the products chosen by the customer to be purchased.

The customer will have access to his shopping basket where he will be able to increase or reduce each product quantity as well as remove them from the basket or finalise his purchase.

=== Technical Context

The system has SOLID architecture in order to respect the privacy of each user's data, this is achieved through the use of PODS to store the user's personal data. The programming language used in the application is Typescript and React is used as the main library to facilitate the development of the application.A certain number of apis were also used to access certain resources.
